I know I'm awesome.

##### Here can find some scripts that enhance your experience on F95zone.

- [Anonym File Skipper](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/raw/main/goodies/anonymfile-timerskip.user.js) `Immediately starts the file download without messing with the timer.`
#### âš  *Notice in case you've just stayed away from Anonymfiles until now* - 
#### The downloads will most probably start in your browser's download manager. Not in IDM, XDM or JDownloader. This happens on Anonymfile by default (at least for me), and is not my script's fault (at least for me :P).  
~ Just a headsup in case your browser doesn't display the "Save As" option.
