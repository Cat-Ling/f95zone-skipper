## F95-Zone.to Masked URL Skipper 🔞

Chrome/Firefox desktop support is a given, the script will work as intended. As for Safari and other Apple jazz, I have no idea.

Confirmed working in (including ultra version now) -
- Cromite (Android) (Native)
- Firefox (Android) (Greasemonkey)

The ultra version is in beta, so it's compatibility may vary.

For support requests in case the script doesn't work as intended, create an issue and add `[support]` in the title. You must include your OS, OS version, and your userscript manager's name in the description.
For feature requests, use `[feature]`.
