# **F95-Zone.to Masked URL Skipper 🔞**

### **Installation: 💿**

1. Make sure you have installed a **[userscript manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager)**:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) for Chrome
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) for Firefox
2. Install one of these userscripts:
   - **[Ultra Version](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/raw/main/f95zone-skipper_ultra.user.js)** (Faster) (Recommended)
   - **[Legacy Version](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/raw/main/f95zone-skipper.user.js)** (Auto-clicks the download button)

### **Extension: DISCONTINUED (Since I'm not an extension developer.) 💿**

1. There is also a **Chrome extension** available. It functions the same way as the Ultra Version.
2. Download the **zip file**:
   - **[Extension](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper@main/F95-skipper_1.4_chrome_extension_beta.zip)** (Beta)
   - It's in beta because it hasn't been tested on any platform other than Windows (Chrome) and Android (Kiwi Browser).
3. Extract the zip file to a suitable location.
4. Go to **Chrome Menu > Extensions > Manage Extensions**.
5. Enable **Developer Mode** on the Extensions page.
6. Click **"Load Unpacked"** and select the folder where you extracted the extension. You're all set!
